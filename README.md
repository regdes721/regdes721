### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a software engineer with a passion for creating beautiful things. 

Prior to App Academy, I earned a Bachelors of Science in Psychology and excelled in various roles, notably achieving Presidentâ€™s Club at Konica Minolta with a $300,000 sales deal. In the summer of 2022, I shifted to the tech industry to harness my creative impulses in art, aesthetics, and writing. After briefly exploring technical writing and AI safety, I discovered a natural desire to learn coding, leading me to enroll in App Academy for a structured upskilling program.

App Academy equipped me with practical skills and technologies, transforming me from creating static web pages to proficiently developing dynamic full-stack applications. I worked with tools like React, Redux, Flask, Express, SQLAlchemy, SQLite3, PostgreSQL, Render, Docker, and AWS. Engaging in pair programming, I contributed to a 2-week group project, a Slack clone with full CRUD features and Websockets. My standout project is the Museum Central website, a clone of Boutiques de MusÃ©es, showcasing my passion for art and creativity with standardized styling using React and Redux, and functionality with React, Redux, and Flask for user interactions.

I am an ideal fit for your company due to my adaptability, quick learning, and creative application of skills. With a diverse background and technical expertise from App Academy, I am a well-rounded software engineer ready to contribute effectively to your team. I look forward to bringing my unique perspective and skills to enhance your company's projects and goals.
